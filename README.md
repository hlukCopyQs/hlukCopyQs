**`DONATIONS:`** if you've found my software useful and would like to donate, then first of all: **Thank you!**

but please note I will not be able to offer anything in return; no support of any kind, not even prioritized features/bugfixes. I'm doing this just for fun, and don't want to make it a responsibility. And like the license says, you're still using it entirely on your own risk :-)

currently the options are [ko-fi](https://ko-fi.com/hlukCopyQs) and [github](https://github.com/sponsors/hlukCopyQs/) -- let me know if you have better ideas,
